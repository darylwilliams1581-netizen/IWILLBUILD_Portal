/**
 * Builds the `CONTENT_UPDATED` message payload for a content-keyed inline edit.
 *
 * Pure and side-effect-free so the *producer* of the `expectedCurrent` guard can
 * be tested in isolation (the hook that calls it opens only on a trusted click,
 * which jsdom can't synthesize). This function decides whether the server-side
 * derived-mismatch guard ever engages: a derived node (`data-dev-content-derived`)
 * carries `expectedCurrent` (the text the user started from) so the server can
 * refuse a save when the stored value no longer matches; a non-derived node omits
 * it entirely, leaving the normal content-edit path unchanged.
